#There is a special value that neither a string (text) nor a number: true 
#There are no quotes around it, and it's not a numeric value
#True is great for situations for checking if a feature is on or if data is available.

#True 
powered_on = True
correct = True
print(correct)

#False is opposite of True
print("Load data")
status = False
print(status)

print("Auto update")
print(False)

# Lesson 2 - The code "not" in front of True makes the expression result in False. If something
#is not true, it has to be false. "not" is the negation operator. It turns values into their opposite.
#When we change a value to its opposite with "not", we negate it. See below
#print(not True)

#The "not" operator before False changes its value. If a value is not False, it has to be True
print(not False)

#We can turn a true to false by print "not" before True
available = True
print(not available)
